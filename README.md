This is a technical test to evaluate your integration and web development knowledge. We will accept submissions in any of NodeJS (TypeScript or javascript), PHP, Java and Python.
 
## Task
* Implement a simple/slim front-end that:
  * Integrates with API from provided link below.
  * Has a list/page of beer items.
  * Should be limited to 15 items per page.
  * List component should support pagination so we can navigate through list pages.

* Implement search component to search through all beers by their name
* Elements could be clickable. In the detailed view, more information should be shown (image, name, abv, volume, description, ingredients, food pairing and brewers tips)
 
## Note

* Must demonstrate good development practices. You are free to use coding frameworks to speed up development and ease styling process.
 
## API for consumption

The above task should be clear and manageable to be completed within ~2 hours timeframe for the experienced developer. If you have any questions feel free to ask as soon as possible as this is a time-critical task.
 
We aren't providing a skeleton project for this - feel free to use a code generator for your preferred platform (e.g. create-react-app). We will be evaluating this as evidence of your ability to develop quality code, so please keep that in mind and consider test coverage and good principles. Better to do a smaller deliverable of excellent quality than to provide more features but in a slap-dash fashion.
